The 2017 MolSSI Software Summer School will be held July 24-August 2 at
Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia. The School will focus on first- and
second-year graduate students in the computational molecular sciences (bio- and
macro-molecular simulation, quantum chemistry, and materials science) whose
research requires a firm foundation in software engineering and programming.

The School’s curriculum will focus on best practices in software engineering –
version control, continuous integration, data management, programming
paradigms, etc. – to promote reproducibility and reliability in research as
well as aspects of modern high-performance computing architectures and code
optimization.

Before coming to the summer school please go through the [setup
instructions](Setup.html).  If you need a Slack invite or have any other
questions please email us (sss@molssi.org).
