# Logistics

## Roanoke Airport Shuttle Information 
### Arrival:
If you are arriving via the Roanoke Airport (ROA) on Sunday, July 23rd you
should have received an email containing the bus information. If you have NOT
received this information please email (SSS@molssi.org) so that we can ensure
that you have a bus to Blacksburg, VA.

### Departure:
In order to simplify return transportation to the Roanoke airport, we will ask
that some participants take the Smartway bus. The Smartway bus is a convenient
alternative that provides inexpensive transportation between Roanoke and
Blacksburg. The Smartway makes frequent stops at the Roanoke airport and
Squires Student Center on Virginia Tech's campus. If your departure time is
during the Smartway bus regular schedule, we ask that you take the Smartway bus
and this is indicated on the attached "Airport Transportation Schedule." The
Smartway bus fee is USD$4.00 (no change will be given, so I recommend having
the exact amount available) and provides comfortable transportation including
free Wi-Fi. Upon arrival, participants should board the Smartway bus at the
specified time directly outside of the baggage claim area and take the Squires
Student Center exit in Blacksburg (shown on the MRPSS website interactive map
under the "Students" tab). When leaving, participants should board the Smartway
bus at Squires Student Center and exit at the Roanoke airport. 

Alternatively, if your departure time is NOT during the Smartway bus regular
schedule, please email us at (SSS@molssi.org) and we will provide a shuttle for
you, and this will be specified on the attached "Airport Transportation
Schedule." Additional information and schedules for the Smartway bus can be
found at http://smartwaybus.com. Any questions about transportation should be
directed to the summer school email address (SSS@molssi.org). 

## Residence Hall information 
All participants will be staying in Campbell Hall on Virginia Tech’s Campus. If
you are checking in between the hours of 11:30am and 4:00pm on Sunday, July 23,
you will go to the registration desk in Campbell Hall to check-in for the
workshop and receive your lodging key. If you are checking in at any other
time, you will need to go to New Hall West to the 24hr desk to check-in and get
your lodging key. During the check-in process, you will receive a personal
Wi-Fi code to use during the week on campus and in the residence halls. Each
participant has been assigned a roommate for the week.  Please note the
residence hall is non-air-conditioned. Please feel free to bring a fan for your
stay. 
To check-out, you will need to place your lodging key and meal card in the box
in the lobby of Campbell Hall.

## Campus Map 
A Virginia Tech campus map can be found on the [VT
website](http://www.maps.vt.edu/PDF/campus-map-highres.pdf). A more concise
interactive map with relevant buildings marked will be provided on the [MolSSI
SSS 2017
website](http://molssi.org/2017/05/07/molssi-software-summer-school-2017/) in
the next several days.

## Parking
If you are driving to the workshop, the closest parking to the residence hall
is around Drillfield Drive. Once you park, you will need to check-in and ask
for a parking pass for the week. Please hang the tag for the duration of the
workshop to avoid getting tickets on campus. If you cannot find parking around
Drillfield drive please park in regular F/S spaces, and avoid 24-hour lots. 

## Reception Sunday, July 23 at 5:30pm 
There is an opening reception on Sunday, July 23 located at the South End Zone
on Beamer Way. VT students holding the MolSSI logo will meet the group
downstairs in the lobby of Campbell Hall at 5:10pm to walk the group over to
the reception. If you cannot meet and walk with the group, please see the

MolSSI headquarters. Shuttle pick up information will be forthcoming during the
